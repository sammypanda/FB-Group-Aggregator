# FB-Group-Aggregator
###### Developed for [Advancing Communities Australia](https://advancingcommunities.au/)
Aggregates the content from a list of FB/Meta groups

## Notable Sections of API
[Getting Group Posts (Graph)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/groups-api/guides#getting-group-posts)
- Being an official way of scraping, it seems this aggregator would need to be present as an "App" on FB itself. Where it can be given more permissions to view more data in a given FB group. 

## Other Notes
[PHP FB Graph SDK](https://github.com/facebookarchive/php-graph-sdk) has been deprecated (PHP 5.x), so instead this project is using [Janu Software PHP Alternative FB Graph SDK](https://github.com/janu-software/facebook-php-sdk) (PHP 8.1).
